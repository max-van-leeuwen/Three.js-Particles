# Three.js-Particles
Rendering particles âœ¨ in Three.js

- Getting a particle's lifetime is tricky in Three.js, but it's essential for effects like fade-out, scale-in, etc.

- This example shows how you can pass the page's 'elapsed time' into the particle material, to be used in combination with each particle's own 'spawn time' attribute in shader.

Example is live at [particles.maxvanleeuwen.com](https://particles.maxvanleeuwen.com)!

Hope this is helpful :)
